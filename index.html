            <p>Dancing, music, and drumming it is big part, this is where we started.<br><br>
            
            I decided to create this organisation from 2021 after finishing my O'level school cause I was at boarding school<BR><BR>Mr.Gerold Dermid gave 
                me big motivation, great inspiration,love and told me that will be an amazing he is first who I told my idea and told me that I will, he is always be there for me <br>
                actually I took him as my Dad because of how He is kind.<br><br>
            I was also at street I spent there a long time but NIYONSENGA Pacifique he came and taught me how to dance, drums and music <br>
            then the way how he helped me it changed me and gave me big motivation to feel that one  day I will create an organisation that will help<br>
            children and other people who have the different problems because I lived at street a long time I know how life from street hurts, that is why I said that as I can<br>
